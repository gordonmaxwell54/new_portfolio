	<h1>Production</h1>

	<p>Production lasted 6 weeks and those 6 weeks were solely spent making my game to the best it could be. I based my game on the concept sketches I created during pre-production and the skills of using GameMaker that I learned sinced the start of the year.</p>

	<p>The first couple of weeks of production were spent creating the main structure of the world and getting the main controls sorted out. As I stated in my blog it was a struggle at first but eventually I managed to get through it, the main obstacle I had was get the jumping mechanic to work perfectly.</p>

	<p>The next couple of weeks were spent creating sprites and putting them into the game, this is where the game came to life as it has vibrant backgrounds and the character had special animations for different actions.</p>

	<p>The final couple of weeks were spent adding the enemies in and making sure that the health bar mechanic and the points mechanic were working perfectly. This was the section of production where I was working the hardest due to the pressure of making sure the game was ready for the presentation and the play test sessions.</p>
