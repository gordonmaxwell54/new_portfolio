<h1>Pre-Production</h1>

<p>Pre-Production only lasted a week so I had to make sure that I had the main designs and plot of the game created ready for when I was going to make the game.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was I created a production timetable to make sure that I sticked to a plan and made sure that I was able to implement everything into my game in time. This timetable took into account the amount of lessons I had a week and how many hours I had during each lesson. It was difficult to plan things in advance but I managed to do it in the end.</p>

<p>After creating my production timetable I had to create some designs for the different characters and stages that would appear in the game. Obviously, I had to make them simplistic as we would be dealing with pixel art so it would be hard to add fine details in the short amount of time that we had.</p>

<p>I also had to do a summary of what my game is going to be like and I had to feature some games that have inspired me to make this type of game. Finally I had to analyse BRAID which was also made with the GameMaker engine. This was used as inspiration for the different mechanics that I could include in the game. I had to look at screenshots and analyse the different functions in the game and how they would be implemented using the controls in GameMaker.</p>
