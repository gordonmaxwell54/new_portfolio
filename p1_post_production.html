	<h1>Post-Production</h1>

	<p>Post-production lasted for 2 weeks and in that time I had to capture some screen footage of me playing through the game and provide a survey for a play test session where people tested my game and gave their opinion on different aspects of the game. In addition to this I had to write a couple reports.</p>

	<p>The first thing I had to do was to get screen footage so that it could be uploaded onto the games design's YouTube page. I was only able to get footage of 2/3 of the game as the capture software suddenly cut out but I do believe that I is still a good amount of footage to have as evidence for my work.</p>

	<p>Secondly, I had to make a survey on SurveyMonkey that I used to get people's feedback on the game after they played on it during the play test session. The minimum number of responses was 10 but I could only get 9 within the alloted amount of time however I do feel like it was a good amount of reaponse to get the best results I could get.</p>

	<p>Lastly, I had to do a couple of reports. One of them was about our career aspiration which was a way of showing our tutors and the college what I wanted to do when I do leave NCN. It wasn't a huge report but it still gave enough information about what I want to do in the future. The second report was about the results of our survey and what I thought about the overall game creating process.</p>
